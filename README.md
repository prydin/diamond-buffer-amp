# A very simple diamond buffer audio amplifier

*** WORK IN PROGRESS ***

## Abstract
This design is based on an idea by the user `No ideas` (yes, that's really his handle) at diyaudio.com. It's a very simple design based 
on an opamp (NE5532 in this case) and a diamond buffer. It has not yet been built, but it's showing promising performance in simulations. 
Check back for more details once a prototype has been built!
